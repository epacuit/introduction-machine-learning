    "## 1. Comparison by Name vs. by Value in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables store references to objects rather than the objects themselves.\n",
    "This means that when you assign one variable to another, both variables point to the same object in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `is` operator checks whether two variables reference the same object (i.e., have the same memory address).\n",
    "In contrast, the `==` operator checks whether two variables have the same content, even if they are different objects in memory.\n",
    "Understanding this distinction is crucial when working with mutable objects like lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we assign `y = x`, both `y` and `x` point to the same object. As a result, modifying `x` also affects `y`.\n",
    "However, `z = x.copy()` creates a new list with the same contents as `x`, so changes to `x` do not impact `z`.\n",
