    "# Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overfitting** occurs when your machine learning model performs very well on training data but poorly on unseen (validation/test) data. Essentially, the model learns the training data \"too well,\" capturing noise rather than general patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several signs that indicate overfitting:\n",
    "- **High accuracy on training data but lower accuracy on validation data**\n",
    "- **Increasing validation loss after some epochs** even though training loss decreases\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras provides several built-in methods to combat overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Early Stopping**: Stops training once the validation performance stops improving.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping\n",
    "\n",
    "   early_stop = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5)\n",
    "\n",
    "   model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50,\n",
    "             validation_data=(X_val, y_val),\n",
    "             callbacks=[early_stop])\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dropout**:  Randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   model = tf.keras.Sequential([\n",
    "      tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),\n",
    "      tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),\n",
    "      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')\n",
    "   ])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **L1/L2 Regularization**: Adds a penalty on the size of coefficients to the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from tensorflow.keras import regularizers\n",
    "\n",
    "   model = tf.keras.Sequential([\n",
    "      tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu',\n",
    "                            kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.01)),\n",
    "      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')\n",
    "   ])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Augmentation**: Increases the diversity of your training set by applying random transformations to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   data_augmentation = tf.keras.Sequential([\n",
    "    tf.keras.layers.RandomFlip(\"horizontal\"),\n",
    "    tf.keras.layers.RandomRotation(0.1),\n",
    "   ])\n",
    "\n",
    "   model = tf.keras.Sequential([\n",
    "      data_augmentation,\n",
    "      tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu'),\n",
    "      tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(),\n",
    "      tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),\n",
    "      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')\n",
    "   ])\n",
