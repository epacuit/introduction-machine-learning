# Colab

[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), commonly referred to as Colab, is a free, cloud-based platform provided by Google that enables users to write and execute Python code directly in a web browser. It is especially popular in data science, machine learning, and deep learning communities due to its simplicity, accessibility, and built-in integration with powerful computational resources.

In these online notes, you will be able to run notebooks in Colab directly from your browser.  To load a notebook in Colab, click on the "Open in Colab" button (![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)) at the top of the notebook.
