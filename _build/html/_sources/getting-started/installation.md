# Installation

This course will use Python, a popular programming language widely used in scientific computing, data science, and machine learning.

To get started, [download Python from the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). We recommend installing the latest version of Python 3.

Alternatively, you can install Python using a package manager. For example:

* On macOS, use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
* On Windows, use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).
* On Linux, use your system's package manager.

Another option is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download#Downloads), an open-source Python distribution tailored for scientific computing.
